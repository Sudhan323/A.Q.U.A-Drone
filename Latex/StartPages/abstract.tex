Underwater drones are very important technology that is required for sea explorations. Development of such drones are increased in India for past few years. Underwater drones are used for underwater inspections of ships, pipelines and aquaculture. Nearly 70 percentage of earth is covered with water. Among these only 30 percentage have been explored the remaining regions are left unexplored. The importance of sea exploration is very high in these days. Due to increase in usage of plastics the plastic wastes are dumped into the sea. This can be monitored using these drones. In this project a drone is construed using PVC pipes, Arduino Mega and four propellers. The drone is controlled by the user from the surface. A camera is attached to the drone to monitor the underwater activities from the surface. The control is done by joysticks which are attached to the control unit.\\\\
